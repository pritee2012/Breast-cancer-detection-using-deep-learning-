## 🧾 Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women. In this project, we use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify breast tissue images as benign or malignant. The model is trained on labeled histopathological image data and aims to assist medical professionals in diagnosis.

## 📊 Dataset

We have used the **Breast Histopathology Images** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images) which contains labeled high-resolution images of breast tissue.

- Classes: `Benign`, `Malignant`
- Input Size: Resized to `224x224` for CNN input
